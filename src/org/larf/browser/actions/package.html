 These actions are added to buttons, menus, etc so that we have a common way of
 carrying out these tasks.
 <p>
 when actionPerformed is called, the action needs to find out which file has
 been selected.  This could be done by using selection listeners, but I thought
 registering huge numbers of actions as event listeners seems a bit silly; instead
 you need to pass in a class that implements a getSelectedFile() method (<i>that</i>
 could be a selection listener).  This might be the StoreTreeView, but in the
 case of the browser for example the file may be selected in the DirectoryListView too.
 <p>
 It then needs to notify any interested components that a file has changed. You can
  register these components as a FileChangedListener with the action, but this
 can be a pain as not all components know about all other components that create
 instances of the actions.  So components can instead register with the FileChangedHub
 singleton, which will always be informed of all FileChangedEvents.
